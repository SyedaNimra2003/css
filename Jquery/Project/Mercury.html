            <p>
                Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is named after the Roman messenger to the gods. It is also the closest planet to the sun and has a very short year, completing a full orbit in just 88 Earth days. Due to its proximity to the sun,
                it has a very hot surface temperature that can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) during the day and drop to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) at night.

            <legend>What was MESSENGER?</legend>
            <p>NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury for more than four years. Among its accomplishments, the mission determined Mercury’s surface composition, revealed its geological history, discovered details about its internal magnetic field, and
                verified its polar deposits are dominantly water-ice. The mission ended when MESSENGER slammed into Mercury’s surface.</p>
