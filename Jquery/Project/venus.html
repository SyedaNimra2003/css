            <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the closest planet to Earth. It is often referred to as Earth's sister planet because of its similar size, composition, and proximity.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Venus has a thick atmosphere made up of mostly carbon dioxide. This atmosphere is so dense that it creates a strong greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures that can reach up to
                    864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The surface of Venus is covered in volcanic features, including vast lava plains, towering shield volcanoes, and deep canyons. The planet also has a thick layer of clouds that are made up of sulfuric acid
                </li>
                <li>Venus rotates very slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. However, it takes only about 225 Earth days to orbit the sun. This means that a day on Venus (one complete rotation) is actually longer than a year on Venus
                    (one orbit around the sun).
                </li>
                <li>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, and its symbol is a circle with a cross, representing the goddess's hand mirror.</li>
                <li> Venus is visible to the naked eye from Earth and is often referred to as the "morning star" or the "evening star" depending on its position in the sky. </li>

            This image shows the surface of Venus, as captured by NASA's Magellan spacecraft. The bright areas are highland regions, while the dark areas are low-lying plains. The circular feature near the center of the image is a volcanic dome called Maat Mons.

            This image shows the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, as seen from Earth. Transits of Venus are rare events that occur in pairs separated by eight years, with more than a century between each pair. The last transit of Venus occurred in 2012,
            and the next one will occur in 2117.
